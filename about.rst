This site is a collection of the notes generated while learning the
`Python programming language <https://www.python.org/>`__.

It is a distillation of the following sources:

-  The official Python docs
-  Dive into Python 3
-  Python Cookbook
-  Python 3 Module of the Week and
-  Various YouTube videos

.. note::
   This is not an attempt to create a *mother of all* guide for all levels of programming expertise.
   If you are a *pythonista* then you can simply *"move along, there is
   nothing to see here"*. However, if you are beginning or an intermediate
   Python programmer, the topics and notes might be useful to improve your
   overall Python programming skill.

I am not computer science engineer. I have programmed in several other
languages including FORTRAN, C, C++, bash, Matlab, LateX (if you want to
call it a programming language). I have been using Python for a while,
but never really committed myself to actually learning the language. I
would constantly find myself aspiring to write great Python code, but
never really did anything about it.

My primary goal was to write idiomatic Python programs. My approach was
to start with a good understanding of what the language has to offer
(aka the Python standard library) without carrying over too much bias
from programming in C/C++. Adopt widely used and established practices
for writing code in Python (PEP-8 and beyond).
